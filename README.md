# Iraq_project
This project is funded by UNDP Iraq, to develop a climate vulnerability index of Iraq and governorate-wise risk comparison.
The main objective of this study is to understand the degree of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of all sectors affected by climate change in order to calculate a Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) for Iraq up to the governorates level and for its key socioeconomic sectors, along with case studies. A Climate Vulnerability Index is typically derived by combining several indicators assumed to represent exposure, vulnerability and adaptive capacity.
